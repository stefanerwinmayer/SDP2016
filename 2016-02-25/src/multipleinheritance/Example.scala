// Example of MI in Scala which uses Type Linearisation

/*
The algorithm goes like this:

+ start building a list of types, the first element is the type we’re
  linearising right now,

+ expand each supertype recursively and put all their types into this list
  (it should be flat, not nested),

+ remove duplicates from the resulting list, by scanning it from the left,
  and removing a type that you’ve already "seen"

+ done.

/*
// start with D1:
B with C with <D1>

// expand all the types until you reach Any for all of them:

(Any with AnyRef with A with B) with (Any with AnyRef with A with C) with <D1>

// remove duplicates by removing "already seen" types, when moving left-to-right:
(Any with AnyRef with A with B) with (                            C) with <D1>

// write the resulting type nicely:
Any with AnyRef with A with B with C with <D1>
