This module (directory) includes an examination of polymorphism compared to pattern matching. To that end there
are a number of examples with "pm" or "poly" in their names. This indicates the approach taken in solving 
exactly the same problem.

* calc (pm, poly) - a calculator example involving various expression types
* cats - a basic examination of polymorphic vs pattern matching approaches
* ll - includes a linked list example in idomatic Scala (FP) style
* tro - contains an example of tail recursive call (optimisation)
